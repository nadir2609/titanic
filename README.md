# üö¢ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project explores the Titanic dataset to build predictive models that determine whether a passenger survived the disaster based on features like age, gender, class, and more. The project walks through data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification model building.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature    | Description                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Survived` | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)                                           |
| `Pclass`   | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)                             |
| `Sex`      | Sex                                                                  |
| `Age`      | Age in years                                                         |
| `SibSp`    | # of siblings / spouses aboard                                       |
| `Parch`    | # of parents / children aboard                                       |
| `Ticket`   | Ticket number                                                        |
| `Fare`     | Passenger fare                                                       |
| `Cabin`    | Cabin number                                                         |
| `Embarked` | Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

## üîß Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning

### 2. Data Preprocessing

### 3. Feature Engineering

### 4. Model Building

Trained and evaluated multiple classification models:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Random Forest**
* **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
* **XGBoost**

Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation.

## üìä Results

Model performance was compared to select the best one based on validation accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) was applied where appropriate to improve performance.

## üìå Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
